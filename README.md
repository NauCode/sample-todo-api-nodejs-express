# Sample ToDo REST API
## Using Node.JS and Express.JS

This is just a (very) basic REST API done to explain the basic concepts around APIs, REST, CRUD... in a blog post I have made here [s](https://google.es).

You can test it just by downloading this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NauCode/sample-todo-api-nodejs-express.git
```

Then:
```bash
cd sample-todo-api-nodejs-express
npm install
npm start
```

And you have the server running! (In localhost:3000) You can test it with Postman as exlained in my blog post.
